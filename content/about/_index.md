Hi! I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at Macalester College studying Applied Math/Statistics, Economics, and Japanese. As of May 20<sup>th</sup>, I'm working as a Data Science Intern in 3M's Finance Division. 

My favorite projects fuse quantitative research, web development, and interactive visualization to investigate and elegantly showcase data.

Here's <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> if you're into that kind of stuff.

#### Broad research interests:
* Statistical Inference
* Sports Statistics
* Urban Economics

Besides that, I enjoy dancing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7g02Rf0LNpVL_Q__yuwjkg/videos" target="_blank">X-ertion</a>, listening to podcasts, reading, and playing video games with friends.
