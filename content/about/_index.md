Hi! I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at Macalester College studying Applied Math/Statistics, Economics, and Japanese. I'm working on a variety of research questions in school ranging from evaluating Bayesian predictive accuracy measures to how public transit shutdowns affect traffic throughout an urban area.

Here's <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> if you're into that kind of stuff.

#### Broad research interests:
* Computational Inference
* Bayesian Inference
* Interactive Data Visualization
* Urban Economics

Besides that, I enjoy dancing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7g02Rf0LNpVL_Q__yuwjkg/videos" target="_blank">X-ertion</a>, listening to podcasts, reading, and playing video games with friends.
