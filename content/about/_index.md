## Son Phan
Hi! I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at Macalester College studying Applied Math/Statistics, Economics, and Japanese. As of May 20<sup>th</sup>, I'm working as a Data Science Intern in 3M's Finance Division. 

My favorite projects fuse _quantitative research_ and _web development_ to investigate data and elegantly showcase insights.

Here's [my resume](/resume.pdf) if you're into that kind of stuff.

#### Broad research interests:
* Statistical Inference
* Sports Statistics
* Urban Economics

Besides that, I enjoy dancing with [X-ertion](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7g02Rf0LNpVL_Q__yuwjkg/videos), listening to podcasts, reading, and playing video games with friends.
