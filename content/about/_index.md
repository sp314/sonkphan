Hi! I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at Macalester College studying Applied Math/Statistics, Economics, and Japanese. I've worked on a variety of research questions in school ranging from evaluating Bayesian predictive accuracy measures to how urban congestion bottlenecks can form through public megaevents such as the 2017 US Presidential Inauguration and the Olympics. In spring 2020 I'm studying abroad in Osaka, Japan on the CET program.

Here's <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> if you're into that kind of stuff.

#### Broad research interests:
* Computational Inference
* Bayesian Inference
* Interactive Data Visualization
* Urban Economics

Besides that, I enjoy dancing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7g02Rf0LNpVL_Q__yuwjkg/videos" target="_blank">X-ertion</a>, listening to podcasts, reading, and playing video games with friends.
