Hi! I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year student at Macalester College studying Applied Math/Statistics, Economics, and Japanese. As of the beginning of this summer, I'm working as a Data Science Intern in 3M's Finance Division. Additionally, I'm working on research involving the volatility of game outcomes across sports.

My favorite projects fuse quantitative research, web development, and interactive visualization to investigate and elegantly showcase data.

Here's <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> if you're into that kind of stuff.

#### Broad research interests:
* Computational Statistical Inference
* Interactive Data Visualization
* Sports Statistics
* Urban Economics

Besides that, I enjoy dancing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7g02Rf0LNpVL_Q__yuwjkg/videos" target="_blank">X-ertion</a>, listening to podcasts, reading, and playing video games with friends.
