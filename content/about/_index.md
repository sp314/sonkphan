# Son Phan
I'm currently a 4<sup>th</sup> year student at Macalester College studying Applied Math/Statistics, Economics, and Japanese. I'm interested in analyzing variability and robustness guarantees of high-dimensional, complex statistical machine learning models. In summer 2020 I am doing machine learning research at the University of Maryland under Dr. Furong Huang through the REU-CAAR program.

Here's <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">my resume</a> if you're into that kind of stuff.

#### Broad research interests:
* High Dimensional Statistics
* Fair Machine Learning
* Nonparametric Bayesian Inference

Besides that, I enjoy dancing with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7g02Rf0LNpVL_Q__yuwjkg/videos" target="_blank">X-ertion</a>, listening to podcasts, reading, and playing video games with friends.
